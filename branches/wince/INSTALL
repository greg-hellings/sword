                       INSTALLATION NOTES


QUICKSTART

Try:

	./usrinst.sh
	make
	su
	make install

If you have never installed sword before and/or are happy with a default
configuration, you may wish to type:

    make install_config

for a basic configuration.  WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE AN EXISTING
CONFIGURATION.  It is OK to rerun this if you have not changed any
parameters in /etc/sword.conf

If the above steps do not work, or if you're particular about your
configuration, please read on.


BUILD CONFIGURATION

What most people consider 'normal' user install options are saved in
a script 'usrinst.sh', which you may run with the command './usrinst.sh'.
You may want to have a look at the configuration options by typing
./configure --help and also looking at what we consider 'normal'
usage parameters by looking inside usrinst.sh
to be sure everything is being built the way that you would like.


BUILDING

A 'make' at the top level directory of the SWORD package should build the
libraries necessary for building any of the frontends.  The libraries will
be built in the ./lib directory.

After the libraries are built, one will probably wish to 'su' to root and
'make install' to install the libraries systemwide.  One then may proceed to
the ./apps directory.  The most basic application that is stable and easy to
build is the cheatah frontend (./apps/X11/cheatah).  These frontends
each have their own make system, so read the help in their respective
directories if a problem is encountered while building.


MODULES

To be useful the software needs to find SWORD 'modules' installed somewhere
accessible.  These module plugins consist of Bible texts, commentaries,
dictionaries, and the like.  New plugins are constantly being added.  They
may be obtained from:
http://www.crosswire.org or various mirrors.

In a default SWORD configuration, a module install may look like this:

[download a module with your favourite client]
su
cd /usr/share/sword
unzip ~/KJV.zip


If you want the details, read on...


A file named 'mods.conf' or directory named 'mods.d' contains all configuration
information regarding the installed modules available to the API.  The format
of a config file is fairly straight-forward, and most modules come with their
own .conf file, of which the contents may be appended to the mods.conf file
or placed in the mods.d directory.

FOR A RECOMMENDED MODULE INSTALLATION SCHEME, SEE
.../sword/samples/recommended, otherwise, the specific details follow:

The API looks for its module configuration in the following sequence:
	./mods.[conf|d]
	$SWORD_PATH/mods.[conf|d]
	$HOME/.sword/mods.[conf|d]
	or finally from information found in a system-wide configuration file
		/etc/sword.conf in the format:
			[Install]
			DataPath=/where/your/datafiles/are/installed
		then the API will look for DataPath/mods.[conf|d]

* NOTE:
Using the above scheme, SWORD will also determine the path to prefix to the
specified datafile location found in the config files.  The prefix path will
be the directory where SWORD finds mods.[conf|d].

Sample config files can be found in: .../sword/samples


LOCALE

If you would like to include support for localization, you may copy the
locales.d directory and any of the locale files contained therein into
the directory where your mods.d or mods.conf file exists
(eg. to /usr/share/sword/locales.d/).


ENJOY!!!
