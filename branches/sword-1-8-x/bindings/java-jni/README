Android Build Instructions

You'll need the Android NDK.

Then link the sword/bindings/java-jni folder to your project's /jni folder.
I have a symlink:

~/src/bishop/jni -> ~/src/sword/bindings/java-jni/jni/

~/src/sword is simply a checkout of the current sword svn repository.
(svn co https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk ~/src/sword)


So, since my $HOME directly is /home/scribe, my configuration looks like this:

/home/scribe/src/sword/
/home/scribe/src/bishop/
/home/scribe/android-ndk-r8e/

with:

APP_PROJECT_PATH := $(call my-dir)/../../../src/bishop
APP_MODULES      := sword swordcore
APP_PLATFORM     := android-3


Hope this helps get you started.  Let me know your progress!
