Android Build Instructions

You'll need an NDK with STL support.  I have been trying crystax' release
lately.  You can find it on the web.

After that, you'll need a basic Application.mk file to place in your
apps folder.  Mine for bishop is here:

~/android-ndk-r3-crystax/apps/bishop/Application.mk

and contains:

APP_PROJECT_PATH := $(call my-dir)/../../../src/bishop
APP_MODULES      := sword swordcore
APP_PLATFORM     := android-3

and I have a symlink:

~/src/bishop/jni -> ~/src/sword/bindings/java-jni/jni/

~/src/sword is simply a checkout of the current sword svn repository.


So, since my $HOME directly is /home/scribe, my configuration looks like this:

/home/scribe/src/sword/
/home/scribe/src/bishop/
/home/scribe/android-ndk-r3-crystax/
/home/scribe/android-ndk-r3-crystax/apps/bishop/Application.mk

with:

APP_PROJECT_PATH := $(call my-dir)/../../../src/bishop
APP_MODULES      := sword swordcore
APP_PLATFORM     := android-3


Hope this helps get you started.  Let me know your progress!
