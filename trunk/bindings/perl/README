Sword version 0.31
==================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALL
-------

tar xzvf Sword-0.01.tar.gz
cd Sword-0.01
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

If you have trouble with the first step, it's because the Makefile can't find Sword.  Set the lib path in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or set the SWORD_LIB_PATH environment variable to the path to libsword.a.


HELP
---
"man Sword" or "perldoc Sword" after install for examples that will help you.
