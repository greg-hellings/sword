// For Sword 1.7.0, the Orthodox versification is limited to the NT. It will expand to include an OT in a subsequent release.
// This NT consists of a union of verses found in the following Bibles, commonly used by Orthodox Christians:
//   OSB (NKJV) NT, NRSV NT, EOB, Antontiades' 1904/1912 Patriarchal GNT
// Though this is heavily weighted towards English translations, it really amounts to the TR and the Patriarchal GNT.
