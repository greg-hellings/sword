Diatheke Suite release 3.0
by Chris Little <chrislit@crosswire.org>

This suite is intended for use with libraries and modules from
the SWORD Project, available at http://www.crosswire.org/

The latest versions of this suite and its components are available
at http://www.gotjesus.org/diatheke/

Version 3.0 of this suite, the second public release, consists of
the following components:

Diatheke 3.0 - a command line utility, good for lots of stuff
Diatheke/CGI 3.0 - a PERL CGI module interface to Diatheke 3.0
Diatheke/Tcl 3.0 - an eggdrop Tcl script interface to Diatheke 3.0
HANDiatheke - a Palm Query App (PQA) for Palm VII or PalmOS devices
              with either Omnisky or Palm Mobile Internet Kit.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING and INSTALLING Diatheke

Just run make.  Now copy the compiled binary, diatheke, to an
appropriate binary location such as /usr/bin.

Now you can run diatheke to learn the general syntax.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS for Diatheke

If you would like Diatheke to log all commands (good for debugging or
if you want to use the history function of Diatheke/Tcl), it can be
enabled quite easily.

First modify diatheke.cpp by uncommenting the line that reads:
#define LOGGING
Then create a file named /var/log/diatheke.log and make it world
writeable.  To do this, perform the following pair of commands as
root:
	touch /var/log/diatheke.log
	chmod 666 /var/log/diatheke.log

Logs will print to this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING Diatheke/CGI

To install Diatheke/CGI, first install PERL and a webserver such as
Apache that is capable of running PERL CGIs.  Installing mod_perl is
recommended for a speed improvement, but is by no means necessary.

Then copy the two .pl files from the ./cgi directory of this
distribution into your cgi-bin directory.  Modify the top of
diatheke.pl to reflect the correct location of your your diatheke
command line utility binary and the default font if necessary. The
CGI is now installed and ready for access.

diatheke.pl is the main lookup script.  dia-def.pl is a supplemental
script used to set a default Bible translation (saved on the 
user's computer as a cookie).

Two sample HTML files are included as sample interfaces for an
general Web-Bible gateway.  index-public.html includes all currently
available free texts while index-private.html includes all currently
available texts, including those which are encrypted because
of copyright and distribution restrictions.  In any case, you should
only use these as a guide, adding and subtracting modules depending
on which modules you have installed and have permission to publish
on the internet or your intranet.  The bottom section of each file
includes an example call to the dia-def.pl script to set a default
Bible version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING Diatheke/Tcl

To install Diatheke/Tcl, install an eggdrop IRC bot, copy the
Diatheke/Tcl .tcl file to your eggdrop scripts directory from this
distribution's ./eggdrop directory, and add a line to the end of
your bot startup script to load the Diatheke/Tcl script.  This
script has been tested with eggdrop 1.3.23 but should function fine
in later versions.

You may need to edit the top of the Diatheke/Tcl file to reflect
the correct locations of your diatheke and dict (if you use it)
binaries.

This is script assumes you have every single SWORD module installed
that was available at the time of release.  Since you probably do not,
remove all modules listed in the pub_books function that you do not
have installed to hide them from end-users.

The !history command only works if you have LOGGING turned on in
diatheke (the command line C program).  This command is commented out
of the help function and must be uncommented to make it show up for
end-users.

The !dict command only works if you have a command line dictionary
program installed on your host such as those listed at 
http://www.dict.org/links.html.

When you get the script loaded, type !biblehelp in a channel where
the bot is present and it will give you a full list of commands.
More commands will appear to you depending upon which mode the bot is
in and whether you are an op on the bot or voiced in the channel.
